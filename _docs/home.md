As a starting point, Funz is the integration of some numerical engineering tools (some that you probably have already used):

* a pre-compilation engine:
  * parsing/replacing variables for your simulation input files (eg. search '$x' everywhere and replace by an arbitrary numerical value),
  * parsing/replacing variables formula (eg. once '$x' i replaced, evaluate and replace '@{$x +1}' also),
* a loop to pre-compile different arbitrary values of '$x',
* a network protocol to send/receive pre-compiled input files on remote calculation servers,
* an output file parser to extract interest values,
* a driver to set up arbitrary values of '$x', possibly coming from a "design of experiments" algorithm (optimization, inversion, sensitivity analysis, ...).
